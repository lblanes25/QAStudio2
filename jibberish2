## Executive Summary

The walkthrough of the CAE Letter and Risk Roll-up Process revealed an effectively designed annual process that aggregates risk assessments across IAG's portfolio. The process maintains clear RCO accountability while providing standardized templates and data support. Multiple review levels, including PGA approval and Independent Leadership Team challenge, ensure quality and consistency. Enhancement opportunities primarily relate to formalizing documentation practices rather than addressing control deficiencies.

## Process Overview

The CAE Letter represents IAG's annual comprehensive risk assessment communication to audit committees. Supporting this letter, the Risk Roll-up Process operates from September through January, culminating in board committee presentations. The Board Reporting Team facilitates this process while Risk Category Owners maintain responsibility for their individual assessments and ratings.

## Process Walkthrough

### Process Initiation and Standardization

The annual cycle begins in September or October when the Board Reporting Team sends a comprehensive kickoff email to all Risk Category Owners. Sarah explained that this communication establishes the framework for the entire process, detailing RCO responsibilities, setting the November submission deadline, and providing the standardized Risk Roll-up Assessment Template.

The team provides substantial data support with this initial communication. Each RCO receives their prior year's assessment results, current audit findings relevant to their risk category, updated MRA status reports, and trend analyses covering multiple years. This supporting information enables informed assessments while maintaining RCO independence in reaching conclusions.

All templates and supporting materials are stored centrally in SharePoint, ensuring version control and accessibility. Laleh emphasized a critical principle: while the Board Reporting Team provides comprehensive analytical support, each RCO retains sole accountability for their assessment content and risk ratings. This structure preserves the independence of risk assessments while ensuring consistency in approach.

### RCO Assessment Process and Quality Validation

Throughout October and November, RCOs work independently to complete their assessments using the standardized templates. The Board Reporting Team remains available for consultation, maintaining a log of common questions to ensure consistent guidance across risk categories. This support proves particularly valuable for newer RCOs or those addressing emerging risk areas without extensive historical precedent.

The templates require RCOs to address several key elements. They must provide their current risk rating with detailed rationale, explain any changes from prior year ratings, incorporate relevant audit findings, consider regulatory developments, and articulate forward-looking risk considerations. The structured format ensures comprehensive coverage while allowing flexibility for risk-specific insights.

As submissions arrive in November, the Board Reporting Team performs initial quality validation. They verify template completeness, check mathematical accuracy of quantitative metrics, ensure consistency between narratives and assigned ratings, and confirm alignment with provided supporting data. When issues arise, the team works directly with RCOs to resolve discrepancies. Cynthia noted that approximately 20-30% of submissions require two to three rounds of clarification before finalization.

A crucial control point occurs with the Portfolio General Auditor approval requirement. Each assessment must receive PGA approval before acceptance, and this review involves substantive evaluation rather than mere administrative sign-off. The PGA considers the assessment's conclusions, supporting evidence, and alignment with broader portfolio perspectives.

### Leadership Review and Challenge

The December Independent Leadership Team review represents a critical governance milestone. The ILT, including the Chief Audit Executive, convenes to review all risk assessments collectively. This holistic approach enables identification of cross-portfolio themes and potential inconsistencies in rating methodologies.

The team demonstrated how the ILT systematically compares internal audit assessments with second-line risk ratings. When discrepancies arise, they conduct root cause analysis to understand the differences. For instance, they described a situation where internal audit rated operational risk as "High" while the second-line assessed it as "Moderate-High." Investigation revealed different weightings of recent control enhancements, leading to additional evidence gathering to support the final determination.

While the challenge process operates effectively, the team acknowledged that formal meeting minutes are not prepared. Instead, they maintain documentation through meeting agendas, email threads capturing challenge questions and responses, and follow-up communications summarizing decisions. Sarah recognized that formal minutes would enhance the governance record, though the current approach provides an adequate audit trail.

### Finalization and Board Integration

January brings the final phase of the process, with activities carefully orchestrated to meet committee reporting deadlines. RCOs may perform "true-ups" to incorporate year-end data, with any material changes requiring expedited PGA review. The CAE provides final approval for all assessments between January 10-17, timing that aligns precisely with committee material preparation schedules.

The Board Reporting Team then synthesizes individual assessments into the CAE Letter narrative. They draft initial content using standardized language while preserving RCO-specific insights, submit the draft for CAE review and revision, and integrate the final letter into committee packages. The resulting communication provides audit committees with comprehensive insight into IAG's risk landscape, highlighting key themes and emerging concerns.

## Special Considerations

### Regulatory Integration

For bank-affiliated entities, OCC Heightened Standards requirements receive particular attention throughout the process. Templates include specific sections addressing regulatory compliance, documentation requirements are enhanced for regulated entities, and ILT reviews include participation from compliance representatives. This regulatory integration has become increasingly important as examination standards continue to evolve.

### Escalation Procedures

The process includes well-defined escalation paths for both timing and quality issues. For late submissions, escalation begins with reminder emails to RCOs, progresses to PGA involvement if needed, and ultimately may require CAE notification. As a last resort, prior period assessments may be used with appropriate disclosure. Quality escalations focus on resolution through specific feedback, focused review sessions, and subject matter expert involvement when needed.

## Enhancement Opportunities

While the Risk Roll-up Process operates effectively, several opportunities could strengthen documentation and governance. Developing formal quality criteria would move beyond professional judgment to provide explicit standards for assessment reviews. This would enhance consistency, clarify RCO expectations, and facilitate training of new team members.

Implementing formal ILT meeting minutes would create a consolidated governance record. While current email documentation provides an audit trail, formal minutes would better capture discussion nuances, document decision rationale, and demonstrate the robustness of the challenge process for regulatory reviews.

The team also identified potential template enhancements, including incorporation of more quantitative risk indicators, expansion of forward-looking risk sections, and development of risk category-specific variations while maintaining overall standardization.

## Conclusion

The CAE Letter and Risk Roll-up Process effectively fulfills its objective of providing audit committees with an independent, comprehensive view of organizational risks. The process successfully balances standardization with professional judgment, maintains appropriate RCO accountability, and incorporates multiple review levels to ensure quality.

The identified enhancement opportunities represent refinements to strengthen documentation and governance rather than remediation of control deficiencies. Through this structured approach to risk assessment and reporting, IAG demonstrates strong support for board oversight responsibilities and regulatory compliance requirements.
