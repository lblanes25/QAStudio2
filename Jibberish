## Executive Summary

The walkthrough of the committee reporting process revealed significant improvements since the prior review conducted four years ago. The Board Reporting Team has successfully implemented comprehensive standard operating procedures, formal regulatory mapping, and robust data validation processes that address previous audit findings. The process demonstrates effective controls over quarterly committee reporting for five of six board committees.

## Process Overview

The committee reporting process follows a structured timeline beginning 4-8 weeks before each quarterly committee meeting. During our walkthrough, the team demonstrated how they transform raw audit data into comprehensive board materials while ensuring regulatory compliance with FRB SR-13-1 and OCC Heightened Standards. The process culminates with secure distribution through BoardVantage four business days before each meeting.

## Process Walkthrough

### Initial Planning and Preparation

The process begins with the team retrieving the prior year's committee deck from the shared drive, which serves as their baseline template. Sarah explained that this approach ensures consistency while allowing for periodic updates and improvements. During the planning phase, the team reviews multiple inputs including the committee charter requirements, annual reporting calendars, and agenda topics provided by the Corporate Secretary's Office.

A critical early step involves establishing the reporting cut-off date in coordination with the Vice President. These dates, typically aligned with month or quarter-end, define the "as-of date" for all reported information. Laleh emphasized that while these cut-offs provide necessary structure, the process accommodates post-cutoff inclusion of significant developments with appropriate CAE approval and disclosure.

### Regulatory Compliance Framework

The team has developed a comprehensive regulatory mapping framework that represents a significant improvement from the prior review. Previously, the review noted that regulatory requirements were considered without specific reference or documentation. Now, the team maintains formal mapping that explicitly links each report component to its regulatory source, whether from FRB SR-13-1, OCC Heightened Standards, or other applicable guidance.

This mapping undergoes validation through multiple mechanisms. The team received a favorable external quality assessment from EY and conducts periodic third-party reviews focused on specific areas like AML compliance. During each reporting cycle, they cross-reference their content against this regulatory mapping to ensure no required elements are omitted.

### Data Collection and Validation

Approximately four weeks before the committee meeting, the Board Reporting Team initiates formal data requests to various teams across IAG. The Professional Practices team provides audit plan status, findings data, and regulatory information. The CPI Team supplies IT MRA and Audit Next Gen updates, while the QA Director provides quality assurance metrics. Administrative updates come from the Director of Operations, and the Chief of Staff provides staffing metrics through the Project Triangle system.

The team accesses Veracity through https://veracity.aexp.com/#/iag/committee to extract automated reports. The system provides two primary data streams: regulatory action plan information and audit plan/findings data. After filtering by committee and timeframe, they export the data for integration into the committee materials.

The critical validation step occurs two weeks before the meeting. Cynthia demonstrated how they reconcile the Veracity extractions against three manually-maintained Excel reports stored at \\nyc-fs01.aexp.com\Group30\IAG\Reporting\Monthly Reports. The Issue Management Report (ME-1) provides comprehensive finding details, the RAP All Report tracks regulatory actions, and the Audit Reports Issued Log confirms audit activity completeness. When discrepancies arise, the team investigates root causes and makes necessary corrections. For system-related issues, they engage support teams who create user stories for permanent fixes.

### Content Development and Review

The validated data is incorporated into a standardized package structure. The Executive Summary spans 1-6 pages and includes the CAE's key messages and risk framework assessment. The Full Committee Report, typically 60-80 pages, provides detailed audit results, findings summaries, and regulatory updates. Appendices vary by committee needs, while Executive Session materials address confidential matters separately.

The review process follows the IAG Approval Matrix with multiple checkpoints. After initial VP review, materials undergo detailed CAE review with incorporated changes tracked throughout. Final approval comes via email from the CAE, which the team retains as evidence. No materials can be distributed without this documented approval. The approved packages are submitted to the Corporate Secretary's Office, who uploads them to BoardVantage four business days before the meeting.

### International Committee Coordination

Cynthia explained her role in coordinating international committee reporting, which operates as an extension of the domestic process rather than a separate function. Regional audit teams receive the base U.S. materials and adapt them for local requirements while maintaining global consistency. The standing agenda includes audit plan status, findings summaries, and subsidiary-specific highlights. Most materials remain in English, though teams in certain markets like Russia may prepare complete packages in local languages when necessary.

## Key Systems and Infrastructure

The process relies on three primary technology platforms. Veracity serves as the central data repository and reporting engine. The shared drive infrastructure provides controlled document storage, with primary materials at \\nyc-fs01.aexp.com\Group30\IAG\2. Departmental Management & Administration and source reports at \\nyc-fs01.aexp.com\Group30\IAG\Reporting\Monthly Reports. BoardVantage provides the secure distribution platform for committee member access.

## Improvements Since Prior Review

The walkthrough revealed substantial enhancements addressing previous audit findings. The team has created detailed standard operating procedures that resolve the prior finding regarding "IAG manual inconsistencies and lack of desk procedures." They've implemented formal regulatory mapping that explicitly connects requirements to report content, replacing the previous informal approach. Quality assurance now includes systematic multi-source reconciliation with documented error resolution procedures. The approval process has been strengthened with comprehensive evidence retention requirements.

These improvements demonstrate the team's commitment to continuous enhancement and their responsiveness to audit recommendations. The external validation through EY's quality assessment provides independent confirmation of the process's effectiveness.

## Observations and Assessment

The committee reporting process operates with strong design and execution. The multi-layered data validation approach effectively prevents errors from reaching committee materials. The regulatory compliance framework ensures comprehensive coverage of requirements while the approval workflow maintains appropriate oversight and accountability.

Enhancement opportunities include formalizing the evidence of annual documentation reviews, developing key performance indicators for process monitoring, and creating standardized tracking for improvement implementations. These represent refinements to an already effective process rather than necessary remediations.

The Board Reporting Team has established a mature, well-controlled process that effectively supports IAG's board reporting obligations while maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements.
