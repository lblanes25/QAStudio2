**Workpaper Prepared By:** [Auditor Name]  
**Review Date:** [Date]  
**Reviewed By:** [Senior Auditor Name]

## Executive Summary

### Overall Conclusion
The committee reporting process operates effectively with controls functioning as designed. Testing of six key controls across four quarterly committee packages identified no exceptions. The process demonstrates significant improvement since the prior review, with comprehensive regulatory mapping through the "Committee Reporting Checklist – Regulatory Mapping," robust data validation procedures using Veracity and ME-1 reconciliations, and systematic approval workflows per the IAG Approval Matrix.

### Testing Scope and Results

| Control Area | Controls Tested | Test Result | Exceptions |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------|------------|
| Process Documentation | 1 | Satisfactory | None |
| Regulatory Compliance | 2 | Satisfactory | None |
| Data Validation | 2 | Satisfactory | None |
| Approval Workflow | 1 | Satisfactory | None |
| **Total** | **6** | **Satisfactory** | **None** |

### Key Improvements Since Prior Review
- Comprehensive process documentation including detailed SOPs addressing previous desk procedure findings
- Implementation of "Committee Reporting Checklist – Regulatory Mapping" for systematic regulatory compliance
- Multi-source validation using Veracity automated extraction with ME-1 Issue Management Report reconciliation
- Enhanced evidence retention in Professional Practices team Share Drive per documented procedures

## Testing Approach

### Sample Selection
We selected four committee packages representing a complete annual cycle with coverage across THE BANK, The Bank, TRS, and international committees:

| Package | Committee Type | Date | Coverage Focus |
|---------|---------------|------|----------------|
| Q1 2025 | THE BANK Audit Committee | March 15, 2025 | Domestic parent company, high-activity quarter |
| Q2 2025 | International Risk Committee | June 18, 2025 | International coordination with regional leads |
| Q3 2024 | The Bank Audit Committee | Sept 20, 2024 | Bank-specific OCC Heightened Standards |
| Q4 2024 | International Audit Committee | Dec 12, 2024 | Year-end CAE Letter and annual topics |

For data validation testing, we selected five critical data points from each package, totaling 20 validation points focused on:
- Audit findings counts (from ME-1 Issue Management Report)
- Past due aging analysis (Column AR - Issue Duration)
- Audit plan completion percentages (from Veracity Committee dashboard)
- Regulatory action plan status (from RAP All Report)
- Committee-specific metrics per charter requirements

### Testing Methodology
Our testing approach combined:
- Documentation review of Process 2025 procedures and supporting materials
- Process observation of Veracity data extraction and ME-1 file creation
- Data validation through systematic reconciliation procedures
- Evidence examination from Professional Practices team Share Drive

## Process Observations

### Strengths Identified

The Process 2025 committee reporting procedures demonstrate strong operational maturity through:

1. **Integrated Timeline Management:** The 4-8 week preparation cycle with specific milestone dates ensures quality without sacrificing timeliness. Cut-off date discipline maintains data currency while allowing adequate validation time.

2. **Technology and Manual Control Balance:** Veracity automation reduces manual effort while ME-1 reconciliation procedures maintain data integrity. The three-way validation approach provides multiple checkpoints.

3. **Clear Data Owner Accountability:** Process 2025 explicitly identifies responsible parties for each content component, facilitating efficient coordination and quality control.

4. **International Coordination Excellence:** The partnership model with regional leads balances standardization with local requirements, as evidenced by successful India regulatory compliance and Russia language accommodations.

### Improvement Opportunities

While no control deficiencies were identified, we noted opportunities to enhance Process 2025:

1. **ME-1 File Creation Automation:** Consider automating portions of the Committee ME-1 file creation process, particularly the column mapping and formula application steps, while maintaining manual validation checkpoints.

2. **Performance Metrics Dashboard:** Develop quantitative indicators aligned with Process 2025 milestones:
   - Data extraction to validation completion time
   - Draft to final approval cycle duration
   - Rework rates by content section
   - On-time delivery percentage to CSO

3. **Regulatory Mapping Enhancement:** While the current checklist is comprehensive, consider developing a dynamic tool that automatically flags regulatory updates requiring Process 2025 modifications.

These recommendations represent continuous improvement opportunities rather than required remediation.

## Conclusion

Testing confirmed that the committee reporting process operates effectively per Process 2025 procedures with all controls functioning as designed. No exceptions were identified across six controls tested through four quarterly packages and twenty data validation points.

The process successfully operationalizes regulatory requirements through systematic procedures, from initial Veracity extraction through BoardAdvantage distribution. The ME-1 reconciliation process, Committee Reporting Checklist – Regulatory Mapping, and IAG Approval Matrix work cohesively to ensure board committees receive accurate, complete, and timely information.

Process 2025 represents a mature, well-documented framework that successfully addresses previous audit findings while maintaining flexibility for committee-specific requirements and international variations.

**Overall Rating: SATISFACTORY**

No management action required. Low-priority enhancement opportunities identified for continuous improvement consideration.
